**SCRIPT GENERATOR**

To run this script, you only have to open it with your Google Colab and run all the cells.

**STEPS**
1. Set you OPENAI_API_KEY and run the cell
2. Run the cells one by one or everyone at once
3. That is all!

This tool is extremely powerful for research purposes, so if you want to use it for researching instead of script generation, just change the prompt templates of the chains!
