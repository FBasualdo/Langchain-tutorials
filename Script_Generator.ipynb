In this blog post, we'll be guiding you through the process of selecting the right components for your custom-built PC. Whether you're an avid gamer, a content creator, or just looking for a new work machine, we've got you covered. Let's dive right in!\\nThe CPU is essentially the brain of your computer. It carries out most of the processing inside your system and determines how fast your computer can complete tasks.\\na. For Gamers: Look for a high-performance CPU, such as the Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7, to handle resource-intensive games. b. For Content Creators: Opt for a CPU with multiple cores, like the Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen 9, to handle multitasking and heavy workloads. c. For General Users: A mid-range CPU, like the Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, should be sufficient for everyday tasks and light multitasking.\\nThe GPU is responsible for rendering graphics and images on your screen. A powerful GPU is crucial for smooth gaming and content creation experiences.\\na. For Gamers: Choose a high-end GPU, such as NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT, for exceptional gaming performance and ray tracing capabilities. b. For Content Creators: Opt for a workstation-grade GPU, like NVIDIA Quadro or AMD Radeon Pro, for improved rendering and video editing performance. c. For General Users: Integrated graphics (built into the CPU) should be sufficient for basic tasks and light gaming.\\nRAM is your computer's short-term memory, used to store data for quick access. The more RAM you have, the better your computer can handle multitasking and running multiple applications.\\na. For Gamers: 16GB of RAM should be enough for most modern games, but 32GB offers more headroom for future-proofing. b. For Content Creators: Aim for at least 32GB of RAM to handle video editing, 3D rendering, and other resource-intensive tasks. c. For General Users: 8GB to 16GB of RAM should be sufficient for everyday use.\\nStorage options include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). HDDs offer more storage capacity for the price, while SSDs provide faster read and write speeds.\\na. For Gamers: A combination of SSD (for the operating system and games) and HDD (for storing other files) is recommended. b. For Content Creators: Opt for a high-capacity SSD (1TB or more) for faster file transfers and improved performance in creative applications. c. For General Users: A 512GB SSD should suffice for most users, but consider a larger capacity or an additional HDD if you store lots of files.\\nThese components are essential for housing and connecting all your other components.\\na. Motherboard: Choose a motherboard compatible with your CPU and GPU, and ensure it has enough expansion slots for future upgrades. b. Power Supply: Opt for a power supply with enough wattage to support your components and ensure it's 80 PLUS certified for energy efficiency. c. Case: Select a case with good airflow and cable management options, as well as enough space for all your components and future upgrades.\\nBuilding a custom PC can be an exciting and rewarding experience.

He specializes in monitors, laptops, storage devices, and other peripherals. Apart from computer hardware, you can also find his how-to and...\\nChoosing a CPU is all about finding the perfect balance between your budget and needs. You definitely wouldn’t want to compromise performance just for a slight difference in price.\\nIt’s essential to understand the basic processor specifications, at the least. Generation, clock speed, cores, threads, cache, and TDP all play crucial roles in determining CPU performance.\\nAlong with that, getting to know the memory and graphics support is also important. Only then should you consider what RAID levels, USB versions, PCIe lanes, and other features the processor supports.\\nWhen choosing a CPU that has the best price-to-performance ratio, it mainly depends on what you’re going to do. \\nHere are my general recommendations on the processor specs that would be ideal for the specified tasks:\\nSpecificationsGeneral Use\\xa0Multitasking\\xa0General GamingHeavy Gaming and StreamingFor EnthusiastsCores / Threads2 to 4 / 2 to 44 to 8 / 8 to 122 to 6 / 2 to 84 to 8 / 4 to 88 and higher / 12 and higherClock Speed (in GHz)1.3 to 2.02.0 to 3.23.2 or higher3.7 and higher3.7 and higherTDP (in Watt)35 to 6565 to 9565 to 9575 and higher90 and higherL3 Cache (in MB)4 to 88 to 128 to 1616 to 2424 and higherMemory (DDR Type/Speed/Size)DDR4 (Upto 2400), 4 GBDDR4 (Upto 3200), 8 GBDDR4 (Upto 3200), 8 GB\\xa0DDR4 (Upto 4266), 16 GBDDR 4 (up to 4266) or DDR5, 16 GB or moreGraphicsIntegrated GraphicsIntegrated GraphicsAdd a dedicated GPUAdd a dedicated GPUAdd a dedicated GPUGeneral CPU specifications for different use cases\\nThe first question is—are you building a new PC or just trying to upgrade to the latest CPU generation?\\nYour option is further narrowed if you’re already equipped with a motherboard. The processor you choose should be compatible with all the other components—primarily the motherboard.\\nBut if it’s the other way around, choosing the appropriate CPU is the first thing to do. Based on this choice, you now need to shop for other compatible components (motherboard, RAM, graphics card, etc.).\\nThe next question is—what are you going to do with your rig? Gaming, streaming, multi-tasking, editing, or a combination of these tasks? You’ll likely find a range of products that matches your demand.\\nTake a quick peek at the below chart on how I have chosen the best processor for different builds.\\nPurposeCPUMotherboardGeneral Use at Home (For Budget)Intel Core i3-10100FASUS PRIME B560-PLUSOffice Use (Intense Multi-tasking and Editing)Ryzen 7 5700GMSI MAG B550M MORTARMain Home PC (Gaming, Streaming, and Rendering)Intel Core i5 12600KASUS ROG STRIX B760-A GAMING WIFIMy systems for different purposes\\nAs you can see, there’s no compulsion in choosing the most recent CPU. If it satisfies your demands and comes at the planned budget, you may go for it!\\nHowever, if you’re looking to build a server or workstation, there are dedicated CPUs for that as well. For instance, Intel offers Xeon processors and AMDs have Threadrippers.\\nAlso, there are AMD Athlon, Intel Celeron, and Intel Pentium processors. All are popular among budget users but are comparatively slower than Ryzen and Core.\\nYour processor must fit perfectly into the respective motherboard slot/socket. If you choose one that’s incompatible, it won’t get sufficient power to operate. \\nIn fact, there’s a chance you may damage/bend the pins during the CPU installation.\\n i3-12100 perfectly fits into the LGA1700 Gigabyte GIGABYUTE H610M S2H\\nThe thing is—custom PC build isn’t just about fitting the components to the right place. It’s more about compatibility! That’s the reason I recommend purchasing the motherboard and CPU together.\\nFirstly, understand that there are two socket types. LGA (Land Grid Array) indicates pins in the motherboard, while PGA (Pin Grid Array) refers to pins in the CPU.\\nAMD Socket AM4 (left) vs Intel Socket LGA1700 (right)\\nAlmost all Intel processors follow LGA packaging while a majority of AMD sockets are PGA. \\nPicking the right brand is a separate topic in itself. Just understand that manufacturers design different motherboards for Intel and AMD.\\nThe CPU sockets have a naming convention. Understanding this will give you an idea of which processor can fit into your motherboard.\\nFor example, most Alder Lake (12th Gen) and Raptor Lake (13th and 14th Gen) go with LGA1700 sockets. So, you need to pair an appropriate LGA1700 motherboard. Note that only a handful of motherboard chipsets support the latest processors.\\nExample: ASUS Product Catalog Page offers shopping motherboards based on different \\nWhen shopping for a motherboard, I always check the manufacturer’s Product Catalog page online.\\xa0\\nBut if you’re trying to upgrade the CPU in the existing system, you’ll likely find CPU/Memory in the model’s Support section. \\nSince the listed products are properly tested, you may choose one that best satisfies your demands.\\nExample: Supported CPUs listed in ASUS PRIME B450 Support page\\nBeginners may even get help from online utilities. Sites like PCPartPicker, PC Builder, and PCspecs let you choose compatible components in a matter of seconds!\\nBefore purchasing any product, I advise developing a habit of checking the specifications. \\nThe same goes for the CPU—this doesn’t just determine the compatibility but even its performance capabilities.\\nDepending on what processor brand you’re going for, you can inspect the official website for full specifications. Don’t worry even if you don’t know what they mean. \\nI’ll briefly explain the most basic ones here.\\nAMD Ryzen and Intel Core aren’t just available for desktops. These companies produce CPUs for laptops and mobile devices too.\\nFor AMD, inspect the Product Line field, and for Intel, look for Vertical Segment. They clearly tell you whether the CPU you’ve chosen is for desktop use.\\nUnderstanding the naming scheme gives you an additional idea when shopping for the right CPU. \\nThe suffix in the product model specifies whether a processor supports integrated graphics, has unlocked cores, is power-optimized, etc.\\nFor example, G series AMD processors are called APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) as they come with graphics cores. \\nLikewise, Intel’s K and F series are the most common. K are unlocked CPUs, while F doesn’t support integrated graphics.\\nBrandSuffixMeaningIntel\\xa0FNo iGPU supportKUnlocked multipliers (best for overclocking)SSpecial processors optimized for performanceTOptimized for powerX, XEFor extreme performance (better than the K and S series)BProcessors supporting Ball Grid Array (BGA) socketsG1-G7, HX, HK, H, P, U, Y, E, UE, HE, UL, HLCPUs for Mobile/Laptops/2-in-1s/Embedded systemsAMDGSupported Integrated Radeon GraphicsGERadeon Graphics + Energy EfficientXBetter than the base version (for example, 2600X > 2600)X3DProcessors supporting 3D caching technologyIntel and AMD Suffixes\\nAll modern processors have multiple cores and threads. The question is—how many are required for you, and should it necessarily be higher?\\nAs a content creator myself, I would say YES—they are important! On my dual monitor setup, I’m always multi-tasking, which involves rendering, writing, editing, running tests, and designing.\\xa0\\nThis is only possible with a high number of cores and threads. So, for me, speed is secondary.\\nCores and Threads comparison between i7-12700 and Ryzen 7 5700G\\nBut if you only play games, these specifications do not matter so much! It would rather be a smart move to go for a higher clock speed.\\nIn fact, for most older games, 2 to 4 cores are more than enough. However, fast-paced video games now take advantage of multiple cores, involving 6 to even 8. \\nThus, it really depends on what you’re trying to play!\\nMoreover, the processor is responsible for basic tasks (mainly involving physics calculations, game logic, etc.). Therefore, it certainly can impact the FPS, especially when the games are CPU-intensive. \\nFor extreme gamers, it’s essential that you pair your CPU with the best graphics card.\\nThe chart below shows the benchmark scores (both single and multiple cores) of different Intel and AMD CPUs at our office. The higher the number, the better the expected performance.\\nThis specification tells us how much power a CPU may consume when it’s under the highest load. \\nNote that TDP is just a rough figure portrayed by the manufacturer and might not always relate to the real-world scenario.\\nKeep TDP as your baseline when purchasing the right cooler for your build. If the cooling solution can’t handle the power consumed by the CPU, you might end up damaging the chip.\\nWhen looking for a cooler, ensure that the cooler’s rated TDP matches or is higher than the CPU’s TDP\\nIf you’re only going to use the processor for basic tasks, a lower TDP should suffice. But for gamers and enthusiasts, overheating is definitely a concern. \\nSo, the best bet would be to go for a higher Watt along with sufficient cooling that matches the rated TDP.\\nAMD CPUs with the ‘X’ and ‘X3D’ suffixes are the ones with the highest TDP. Such processes do not get shipped with a Wraith Prism, which is often included with the ones having lower TDP.\\xa0\\nRyzen 5 5700G comes with Wraith Stealth (top) but Ryzen 9 7950X3D recommends using a liquid cooler (bottom)\\nThis is because even the manufacturer wants you to use the best liquid or air coolers. Interestingly, this is even included in the CPU specifications.\\nNot all lntel processors provide the exact TDP rating. Instead, you need to look for Processor Base Power and Maximum Turbo Power.\\xa0\\nThe former tells you the average heat generation during complex workloads (at the base frequency). The latter represents the heat generation when the CPU runs in Turbo Frequency.\\nAdditional Tip: When performing intensive tasks or overclocking, CPU temperature can rise more than expected. To keep a baseline, I suggest noting the maximum temperature from the Specifications.\\nNot all processors access data from the RAM. CPU stores some of these in their own volatile cache memory to execute tasks faster.\\nThere are three levels of cache (namely, L1, L2, and L3). Among these, the first level is the fastest, and the third has the highest capacity.\\nChecking CPU Cache in Intel (top) and AMD (bottom) Specifications Page Online\\nThe more the CPU can store data in the cache, the better the performance. The latest processors now come with 32 to even 128 MB L3 cache capacity.\\xa0\\nSo, your primary focus should be on L3. In fact, this level is shared by every CPU core and is responsible for feeding the other two.\\nWhether you want to run multiple memory channels or future-proof your rig with DDR5 support, the CPU must support them.\\nChecking Memory supported by Intel and AMD CPUs\\nBesides, other factors, including maximum memory capacity, RAM speed, and ECC support are also determined by the processor.\\nBoth Intel Core and AMD Ryzen bring improvements to every new generation. Thus, you can expect better performance, more cores, and overall better specs on their latest CPUs.\\xa0\\nGoing for the brand modifier wouldn’t be a bad idea when comparing CPUs from the same generation. \\nFor instance, every desktop CPU from Intel Core i9 12th gen will outperform those from the i7 12th gen.\\nBut what if we compare a lower generation from a higher Intel Core with a higher generation from a lower one? \\nCPUCores/ThreadsBase/Max FrequencyTDPMax.

But it’s worth mentioning that the 10th-gen i7 processor slightly beats the 9th-gen i9 in every aspect.\\nHowever, the CPU generation matters if you’re planning for better RAM specifications. \\nAs you can see, the high-generation i5 and i3 support better memory speed. In fact, if you have a DDR5 motherboard, only the i2-12100 would be your option.\\nThe case is identical for Team Red users. Let’s check the comparison on Ryzen 7 and 5 AMD CPUs from different series:\\nCPUCores/ThreadsBase/Max FrequencyMax.

But when it comes to speed and memory specs, the higher the generation, the better. \\nFor instance, the 7000 series from Ryzen 5 is way ahead of 2nd gen Ryzen 7.\\n‘Integrated graphics’ is another important thing to consider when choosing a CPU. As discussed earlier, most Intel processors (except the F suffix) and AMD APUs support built-in GPUs.\\nIt’s mostly the ones with the ‘G’ suffix for Team Red. However, there are exceptions! \\nFor instance, all Ryzen 7000 series (except Ryzen 5 7500F) have graphics cores in the processor chip.\\nYou certainly can add a discrete graphics card and disable the iGPU option from BIOS. \\nBut if you’re really planning to install a GPU, it’s better to pick the base variant (for basic use) or the one with the ‘X’ suffix (for enthusiasts).\\nExample: Setting Graphics Adapter to PEG will disable integrated graphics in MS motherboards\\nWhen looking for the best CPU with integrated graphics, it’s essential to consider the relevant graphics specs. These include core counts, frequency, number of displays supported, etc. \\nAlso, here’s a guide to help you choose the best motherboard with integrated graphics.\\nUsers who plan to install an add-on card along with an M.2 SSD are advised to choose a CPU that supports enough usable PCIe lanes. \\nAlso, to get the maximum benefits, I suggest matching the PCIe version (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0).\\nDon’t get too stressed about this, though! All PCIe revisions are forward and backward-compatible. \\nThe setup will work but use the lowest specs and may even lead to performance bottlenecks.\\nThat’s exactly what happened to us when pairing RTX 4080 with Ryzen 5 5600. We couldn’t get the benefits of PCIe 4.0 as the graphics card ran at the CPU-supported PCIe 3.0 specs.\\nWhile most factors have now been covered, there might be additional features you might want to look up. These include support for advanced technologies, like,\\nIntel Adaptive Boost, Intel Turbo Boost, Intel Boot Guard\\nUSB types (A or C) and versions (especially 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 support)\\nThese features are actually secondary. What matters is future-proofing. \\nIf you do not wish to upgrade your build for the next few years, I suggest going for the latest CPU.\\nAmidst the popularity of crypto trading, we have got you covered with the best CPUs for crypto mining. For such, you’ll need to go for high specs—more cores and threads, faster speed, higher TDPs, and better cooling.\\nConsidering the latest generation, the number of cores, threads, power delivery, and total cache are all important. \\nBut as I stated earlier, it comes down to your needs—and most essentially if it fits into your budget.\\nThrough this guide, I believe I have done the groundwork for you. Now, it’s your turn to compare the different CPUs through your own research.\\nFor demonstration, I have compared i3-8100 with Ryzen 3 2200G for a budget build office setup:\\nSpecificationsIntel Core i3-8100Ryzen 3 2200GCores/Threads4/44/4Base Clock Speed3.6 GHz3.5 GHzTDP65 W65 WCache6 MB4 MBMemoryDDR4 2400 MT/sDDR4 2933 MT/sGraphics (Frequency)350 MHz1100 MHzBenchmark Score (Single/ Multi Core)719 / 2990751 / 3456Cost (Amazon)$110.00$150.00Intel Core i3-8100 vs Ryzen 3 2200G\\nHere, Ryzen 3 has a slight edge over the Intel Core i3 processor. Specifically, the memory and graphics are much better. That’s probably why it scored higher during the benchmark using Cinebench R23.\\nThe better one always costs more—and the above example shows it all. But here’s a surprise—we got this Ryzen CPU in the Black Friday deal (with 33% off).\\nSo, you see, a smart move would be looking for such offers online. I am not recommending Amazon—you can find deals anywhere, even in the nearest brick-and-mortar stores.\\nAnd during your research, just don’t stick with one YouTube video or a guide from a single tech site. \\nTake your time and check reviews and benchmarks from multiple sources. \\nList down the pros and cons, and try to see how you can tackle the drawbacks that you find.\\nHow To Know if CMOS Battery Is Dead\\nHow To Know if CMOS Battery Is Dead\\nFix: “You Must Be an Administrator Running a Console Session in Order to Use SFC Utility”\\nComputer Turns On But Monitor Says No Signal (9 Ways To Fix)\\nHow to Enable or Disable Secure Boot for ASUS Motherboard\\nHow to Run Dual Monitors With One HDMI Port\\nWhat Is CPU Cache?

We compare the measurement capabilities of these products side-by-side, trying them out with everything from delicate digital circuits to typical residential electronics. We rate and score their convenience and ease of operation, included probes, AC & DC measurement functions, and any other testing capabilities they have. Our hands-on evaluations point out which meters are best for beginners and high-end applications and which have the most functionality and features for testing electrical systems.\\nIf you\\'re working on a DIY project that includes multimeter use, we have plenty of other reviews for products you\\'ll likely be utilizing. Check out our articles on the best heat guns, our favorite tool sets, the best drills and best circular saws. We\\'ve also tested useful auto tools like the best jump starters to keep in your car. Looking at these reviews can help save you the time and headache of figuring out which products are worth your money and which aren\\'t.\\nEditor\\'s Note: We updated our multimeter review on June 12, 2023, to ensure our selection is up to date with current product pricing.\\n$282 List$227.88 at Amazon$46 List$26.98 at Amazon$30 List$26.99 at Amazon$55 List$54.97 at Amazon$24 List$23.99 at Amazon\\nTechnical measurements, easy to use, handy featuresEasy to use, tons of measuring capabilities, kickstand and hangerIncludes case, point, and alligator probes, easy to useCompact, temperature probe, well builtEast to use, alligator and point probes included\\nExpensive, no transistor gain measurementLarger, slightly more expensiveNo thermocouple, non-contact voltage sensorLacks alligator clips, dial is hard to twist, must hold light button 1.2 seconds before screen illuminatesNot true-RMS, no temperature measurement\\nIf you are a highly technical user with complex electrical projects, this is the meter for youUser-friendly with a large screen and a multitude of measurement capabilities, this multimeter is the best bet for most peopleFor those just getting started with DIY electrical projects who are trying to save some cash, this is a great choiceA great, compact multimeter with a rubberized exteriorThis all-around solid meter is a good option for beginners on a budget\\nSCORE    DC Measurements 8.0        AC Measurements 8.0        Other Functions 9.0        Ease of Use 7.0        Included Probes 7.0       Auto-Ranging: Yes | True RMS: Yes\\nREASONS TO BUYVery easy to useTons of measurement capabilitiesLarge displayREASONS TO AVOIDKickstand is difficult to deployUniversal socket for component measurements is finickyThe AstroAI 6000 earns its spot as our all-around favorite multimeter. Compared to other premium products, this model combines an impressive set of AC and DC measurement capabilities in a convenient and affordable package. This meter has plenty of additional functionality, allowing you to check components like transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, along with measuring temperatures using the thermocouple. The AstroAI 6000 is an excellent option for DIY electronic projects, household wiring repair, or working on 12/24 VDC systems found on cars and boats. \\nHowever, there are some minor shortcomings to consider. For instance, the magnetic hanger is not incredibly strong, so you might unintentionally knock it off if you are using it to adhere the meter to a magnetic object. Furthermore, the magnet has a tendency to collect metal flakes, component leads, dirt, and other loose metallic objects. The kickstand is somewhat tricky to unfold, and we found it hard to pull the probe covers off when you need longer ones. The AstroAI 6000 has a higher tolerance than some models on the market, but this most likely won\\'t matter much unless you are doing very high-end technical work. These critiques aside, this is an exceptional digital multimeter. The AstroAI 6000 is a terrific tool for troubleshooting all sorts of circuits and wiring and is the multimeter we recommend first for most people.\\nUsing a meter to measure a resistance can be a bit more foolproof than relying on the color codes for beginners - especially if you have a hard time actually seeing the colors.Credit: David Wise\\nSCORE    DC Measurements 8.0        AC Measurements 8.0        Other Functions 7.0        Ease of Use 8.0        Included Probes 8.0       Auto-Ranging: Yes | True RMS: No\\nREASONS TO BUYEasy to useCompactREASONS TO AVOIDReduced measurement functionsWe recommend the Crenova MS8233D for beginner DIYers getting started with electrical projects. This capable multimeter is jam-packed with functionality at a price that won\\'t break the bank. It can measure resistance, alternating and direct current, voltage, and frequency. It has a continuity check and a diode test, allowing the current to run in one direction. This device also includes handy features like a backlight, hold, and max functions. This Crenova model comes with the typical point probes, a pair of alligator clip test leads, and a nice storage case to keep it protected in your tool bag. \\nBuilt with beginners in mind, this meter lacks some of the more advanced features, like a temperature probe or a dedicated transistor test. It only has a maximum function — no minimum function. Still, it\\'s a great value and easy to use, so we think the Crenova MS8233D more than compensates for its flaws, making it our top recommendation to beginners or those looking for basic functionality at a bargain. \\nThe MS8233D includes alligator clip probes, which can take the hassle out of measuring resistors.Credit: David Wise\\nSCORE    DC Measurements 6.0        AC Measurements 6.0        Other Functions 6.0        Ease of Use 5.5        Included Probes 6.0       Auto-Ranging: No | True RMS: No\\nREASONS TO BUYLow costUnique featuresREASONS TO AVOIDHarder to useNo auto-offIf you only have the occasional electrical project and are shopping for a low-cost option to toss in your toolbox, check out the AstroAI AM33D. This simple multimeter can help with troubleshooting AC and DC circuits and has the crucial audible continuity check to help you track down a broken wire or loose connection. It includes a set of simple probes and has some of the basic convenience features we want in a multimeter, like an integrated backlight and a data hold function. It also features a square wave generator, though that\\'s a feature most people likely won\\'t use much. \\nUnfortunately, this meter isn\\'t auto-ranging, which we feel is the main downside. This can make it far more challenging for beginners to use — and it can even trip up some more advanced users if they aren\\'t paying attention. We wish the backlight was a tad brighter and the integrated stand held the meter at a better viewing angle. Despite these flaws, this multimeter can get the job done at a fraction of the cost of the high-end models and is a good choice if you don\\'t frequently need to use one of these tools.\\nThe AM33D by AstroAI has a built-in square wave generator.Credit: David Wise\\nSCORE    DC Measurements 8.0        AC Measurements 9.0        Other Functions 7.0        Ease of Use 8.0        Included Probes 7.0       Auto-Ranging: Yes   | True RMS: Yes\\nREASONS TO BUYAllows you to take very technical measurementsAn exceptional suite of AC measurement abilitiesIntegrated non-contact voltage probeREASONS TO AVOIDExpensiveNo dedicated transistor socketsThe Fluke 117 is a highly technical meter for highly technical work. Offering plenty of advanced features and functions, this DMM is designed with electricians in mind — especially when it comes to taking AC measurements. We love that it features an integrated non-contact AC probe and comes with a clear and intuitive interface. This true-RMS meter also has a low-impedance input that can automatically detect the type of voltage being measured and choose the appropriate range. Additionally, you can purchase a current probe separately if you need to measure anything above 10 amps. \\nThe Fluke 117 offers a wide range of technical measurement functions, but it is geared more towards those working on home or commercial wiring rather than a hobbyist playing around with DC circuits. The unit also costs significantly more than an amateur may want to spend, and it lacks dedicated NPN/PNP transistor testing. Still, this is an excellent professional-grade multimeter — it\\'s just a little bit more specialized than many people\\'s electrical projects require. \\nThe Fluke 117 is a high-tech multimeter designed with electricians in mind.Credit: David Wise\\n Compare Products   Compare select up to 5 products to compare             Score Product Price     81 Fluke 117 Electricians True RMS\\nBest for Electricians and Advanced Users $282  79 AstroAI 6000\\nGreat Value for Beginners $30  78 Klein Tools MM400 $55  76 Neoteck NT8233D Pro $24  76 Etekcity MSR-C600 $30  75 Greenlee DM-45 600 Volt $66  74 Innova 3320 $42  59 AstroAI AM33D\\nBest for Tight Budgets $17  59 Etekcity MSR-R500 $13     \\nWe buy and hands-on test each model we review across the same metrics to bring you our results-based assessments.Credit: David Wise\\nWorking with high voltages, currents, and electrical systems is inherently dangerous. Using a multimeter is no substitute for proper training and knowledge. If you are unsure or confused about what you are doing, then you most likely shouldn\\'t be doing it. At some point, you do need to leave it to a licensed professional.\\nWe spent hours comparing and scoring these products side-by-side, completing several electrical projects along the way. We checked the resistance, capacitance, and gain of a plethora of electrical components, as well as the voltage of just about every outlet and battery we could find. Our testing gave us important insight (and some strong opinions) about the included probes and each meter\\'s overall functionality and user-friendliness. \\nThe overall score for each multimeter comes from testing across five key metrics:\\nDC Measurements (30% of overall score weighting) AC Measurements (30% weighting) Other Functions (15% weighting) Ease of Use (15% weighting) Included Probes (10% weighting)\\nOur expert multimeter tester, David Wise, has well over a decade of experience designing electronic circuits and building electromechanical systems. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Ocean Engineering from MIT in 2014, he worked on the electronics systems for deepwater ocean gliders, electric Formula-style race cars, and developed hands-on electronics curriculums for local schools. He is a published author in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers\\' Young Engineers Paper contest for his work on the design and prototype of an electromagnetic gallium pump. He also has a broad background in digital and power electronics. He is an avid DIYer, undertaking plenty of electrical projects and improvements on his home — with only the occasional unexpected spark. David has spent more hours than he would like debugging and testing various systems with practically every type of multimeter imaginable, bringing extensive experience to this review. \\nJoining David are Research Analyst Jessica Riconscente and Review Editor Ross Patton. Jessica attended California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obisbo, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology. A third-generation scientist, she is no stranger to uncovering the intricacies and subtle differences in data that differentiate a top-notch product from one that is better left on the shelf. Ross graduated with a Bachelor of Environmental Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. During his five years as part of the GearLab team, he has reviewed dozens of technical products ranging from electric skateboards to WiFi extenders. Between the three of them, you can be sure that their findings will guide you to the best multimeter for your needs and budget. \\nJust another day in the office.We purchase all of the products in our reviews from the same retailers as our readers.Some models such as the Greenlee DM-45 include temperature probes also known as thermocouples.\\nTo determine which multimeters are the cream of the crop, we tested them head-to-head to score and rank all of their different functions. We compared their electrical testing abilities, ease of use, and operation. We also included probes with our side-by-side analysis in the following sections. Lastly, we divided electrical measurement capabilities into DC and AC voltage and current, as well as other functions for ease of understanding. While a few features can fall into multiple categories, we\\'ve left these in the most commonly used category for clarity. \\nIf your budget is limited and you are doing your best to balance performance and cost, we highly recommend the Crenova MS8233D. This auto-ranging multimeter has most of the common measurement functions and is very easy to use, all at a relatively affordable price. The AstroAI AM33D is another excellent option if you are shopping on the tightest of budgets, but the lack of auto-ranging makes it a bit more difficult to use. \\nThese less expensive multimeters will typically have a reduced set of measurement capabilities compared to the top-tier models. For example, the Crenova and the AstroAI AM33D can\\'t directly measure the gain of an NPN or PNP transistor like the AstroAI 6000 can or lack a non-contact voltage probe, as the Fluke 117 has. However, these budget meters typically cover all the basic measurements a typical DIYer or homeowner will likely ever need. You should think carefully about the projects you have in mind and make sure you aren\\'t paying for an overly technical or complex meter that your electrical projects might not require. \\nThis metric considers each device\\'s Direct Current (DC) measurement abilities. Most electronics hobbyists get started with low-voltage DC circuits, given they are less risky and much more forgiving in nature. We rated and compared the DC voltage and current measuring abilities of each product and any other unique DC-specific features for each model.\\nThe AstroAI 6000, Crenova MS8233D, Etekcity MSR-C600, Klein Tools MM400, Greenlee DM-45 600 Volt, and Fluke 117 all impressed us in this regard. When taking a DC voltage, all of these meters are auto-ranging, making them very easy to use. We found the Crenova and the Fluke 117 to be very accurate, having a listed tolerance for most ranges of plus/minus 0.5%. However, when measuring current with the AstroAI 6000 and the Crenova, you\\'ll need to set the correct range — something you don\\'t need to do with the Fluke 117, which can automatically select the range for you. \\nWhile the Etekcity MSR-C60 is mainly useful for measuring large AC currents, you can still measure other things, like the voltage of an SLA battery.Credit: David Wise\\nAn automatically ranging (aka, auto-ranging) multimeter can be much easier to use, especially for those just getting started with these products. This means that the meter will automatically pick the correct range for things like voltage measurements. You just set the dial to DC or AC voltage, and the meter will show the correct measurements. Manual or non-auto-ranging meters require you to set the correct scale for an accurate measurement. For example, you might have five different options when it comes to DC voltage measurements (0-200 millivolts, 0-2000 millivolts, 0-2 volts, 0-20 volts, 0-200 volts, and 0-500 volts). The meter will usually show a 1 or an overload symbol if you try and measure a voltage higher than the set range. The precision (number of decimal places) will also change depending on your scale, so you need to think about what you are measuring and try and select the smallest scale to get the most accurate measurement. \\nThe AstroAI AM33D is rated to measure up to 500V with a Category II insulation rating. However, it isn\\'t auto-ranging, so you need to set the appropriate scale for your measurement, choosing between 0-200mV, 0-2000mV, 0-20V, 0-200V, 0-500V, with the precision (number of decimal places) of each measurement changing for each range. \\nAlso standing out in this metric with its series of common-sized built-in battery load testers is the Innova 3320. One of three LEDs will light up to let you know if the battery is charged, on the border, or depleted. \\nThe Innova 3320 gives you a visual LED indicator for the amount of charge in a few common batteries.Credit: David Wise\\nNext, we compared how these products did with Alternating Current (AC) circuits. We rated and scored things like the voltage and current measurement capabilities and any other AC-related features, like a non-contact voltage sensor or current measuring clamp. \\nTwo products immediately stand out when measuring AC voltage and current: the Fluke 117 and the Etekcity MSR-C600. The Fluke 117 is an electrician\\'s True-RMS multimeter, featuring a series of advanced AC measurement tools, like an auto-volt feature with a low-impedance input and a non-contact voltage sensor. It is auto-ranging for alternating current and voltage and can measure frequency. \\nThe non-contact VoltAlert sensor on the Fluke 117 is a quick and easy way to check if there is power, though it can sometimes be fooled by shielded conductors or other circumstances, so you should always double-check before working on the circuit.Credit: David Wise\\nHowever, when measuring large alternating currents, even the Fluke 117 is outperformed by the Etekcity MSR-C600. While the Fluke can only measure up to 10 amps of current in its stock configuration, the Etekcity can measure up to 400 amps using its non-contact current clamp. Even better, you don\\'t need to break the circuit and wire the meter in series when using a non-contact clamp. This feature works best when you only measure a single, unshielded wire at a time. However, you can buy a current clamp separately for other products, like the aforementioned Fluke or the AstroAI 6000, if you want to measure higher currents with other products. \\nIt is also worth noting that, like the Fluke 117, the AstroAI 6000 is a True-RMS meter. This means they can more accurately measure complex electrical waveforms, like those found in HVAC systems or variable motor drives — particularly brushless motors and their electronic speed controllers. \\nWhile AC and DC measurement abilities are critical for any good multimeter, it is important not to disregard all of the other measuring capabilities these products have. All of the models we tested have a diode, resistance, and audible continuity check, with a few meters going even further. The AstroAI 6000 can also measure capacitance, transistor gain, duty cycle, and temperature using its K-type thermocouple. \\nThe Neoteck NT8233D Pro, Fluke 117, and the Crenova MS8233D can also measure capacitance. The AstroAI 6000 can be helpful with its NPN/PNP transistor gain functions if you are doing lots of circuits with surplus transistors. While this isn\\'t the most useful, it can be handy for getting a rough idea of the DC gain when using surplus parts or other semiconductors that you can\\'t locate the datasheet for. We found the universal socket on the AstroAI 6000 to be a bit finicky, too, and see potential that we would lose it at some point. \\nThe thermocouple, probes, and universal socket for component testing all are included with the AstroAI 6000.Credit: David Wise\\nWhile this isn\\'t necessarily a measurement function, both the AstroAI AM33D and the Etekcity MSR-R500 have a dedicated square wave output, which is useful for testing amplifier circuits. These also have a diode check — handy if you are working with LEDs.\\nThe square wave function can be very useful for testing oscilloscopes or amplifiers.Credit: David Wise\\nThe Klein Tools MM400 has continuity and resistance under the same setting. It defaults to continuity, so you\\'ll need to remember to press the select button until you see the resistance icon show up. In addition to measuring capacitance, frequency, and duty cycle, this model includes a thermocouple probe that is rated at 1000Â° F. \\nThe Klein Tools MM400 can read temperatures up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.Credit: Abriah Wofford\\nAfter the electrical measurement tests, we rated and scored how easy it was to use each device. We considered how simple or challenging it was to set the range, if the device comes with a \"Max,\" \"Min,\" or \"Hold\" option, whether or not there is a backlight, the quality of the kickstand, and the overall user interface. \\nIn terms of setting the range, you can\\'t beat any of the auto-ranging meters. In our lineup, those are: the AstroAI 6000, Crenova MS8233D, Fluke 117, Neoteck NT8233D Pro, Etekcity MSR-C600, Greenlee DM-45 600 Volt, and Klein Tools MM400.\\nThe Klein Tools MM400 and Greenlee DM-45 are both capable of auto-ranging.Credit: Abriah Wofford\\n\"Hold,\" \"Min,\" and \"Max\" functions are also quite handy when diagnosing circuits, something the Fluke 117, Klein Tools MM400,  Greenlee DM-45, and the AstroAI 6000 all have. Except for the Innova 3320 and the Etekcity MSR-C600, most of the tested products also have a backlight. \\nWhile it\\'s not recommended to work on electrical projects without proper lighting, the integrated backlight can make it easier if you absolutely have to.Credit: David Wise\\nWhile most of these devices include a kickstand, the AstroAI 6000 also has a handy magnetic hanging strap. The Fluke 117 has this too, but it is sold separately. However, we do like the integrated probe holders on the Fluke 117, which keep the test leads nice and organized. \\nThe AstroAI 6000 has both a kickstand and a magnetic hanging attachment.Credit: David Wise\\nThe Klein Tools MM400 features one of our favorite kickstands. The stand props the device up at a great viewing angle, and it stays in place, even when shaken or bumped. The hard rubberized bottom grips the surface on which it is placed so that it won\\'t slide around. If you like the idea of being able to hang your multimeter, the Greenlee DM-45 has an integrated hook. \\nWe appreciate the Klein Tools MM400\\'s kickstand. It\\'s easy to use, stays set at your desired angle, and the rubber prevents it from slipping around.The Greenlee DM-45 has a hook on the back for hanging the meter while working or while it\\'s not in use.\\nFinally, we assessed the quality of the included probes. Since you can always get higher-quality probes separately, it doesn\\'t make a huge difference. However, there are a few standouts that are worth mentioning. \\nWe like the safety covers included with some probes, such as the ones on the Fluke 117, Klein Tools MM400, Greenlee DM-45, and the Neoteck NT8233D Pro. These let you change the amount of conductive surface exposed to match the application. We also appreciate that the Neoteck NT8233D Pro and the Crenova MS8233D include the typical point probes and a pair of alligator clip probes.\\nYou can remove the insulating cover to expose more of the probe if necessary.Checking the value of an electrolytic capacitor with the Neoteck\\'s included alligator clip probes is a breeze.\\nThe clip probes can be exceptionally convenient for measuring components or other circuits and give you a reliable way to get a good connection without holding the probes in position. This frees up your hands and reduces the likelihood of an intermittent connection. \\nWe conducted hands-on testing of all of these multimeters in order to determine the best.Credit: Abriah Wofford\\nOur review includes the information and details you need to narrow down the options to the perfect multimeter for your needs and budget. Remember, working on electrical circuits and systems can be extremely dangerous and should only be done if you have the proper knowledge and training.

This is primarily due to their decreasing costs, improved performance, lightweight design, and space-efficient nature, resulting in higher energy density than other battery types.\\nNevertheless, alternative battery technologies are emerging as viable options. For example, Sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries offer high energy, power density, and long lifespan. However, it is important to note that Na-S batteries have certain hazards, including flammability and explosiveness. As a result, they are more suitable for stand-alone renewable energy storage applications, where these risks can be isolated and managed effectively.\\nLiquid electrolyte-based flow batteries are gaining traction in the market, especially in large-scale applications, as they can store energy efficiently. They offer a long lifespan, fast response time, high scalability, and very low fire risk, but they provide relatively low energy capability and slow charging/discharging rate. Lithium-ion will continue to be the most common BESS technology for the foreseeable future. More than 90 percent of large-scale BESS systems in the US use lithium-ion batteries, according to the US Energy Information Administration, a penetration rate that is typical around the globe.\\nGenerally, it is best to keep batteries at a moderate, consistent temperature to ensure optimal performance and longevity. Exposure to extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, can damage batteries and cause hazardous events.\\nThe specific temperature range that batteries require to operate safely can vary depending on the type of battery and its design. The safe operating temperature range is typically between -20°C and 60°C for lithium-ion batteries, between -20°C and 45°C for nickel-metal hydride batteries, and between -15°C and 50°C lead-acid batteries. It is important to carefully consult the manufacturer’s specifications for the specific battery type to determine its precise, safe operating temperature range.\\nAccording to the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the optimal temperature range for Lithium-Ion is between 15 °C and 35 °C. Research shows that an ambient temperature of about 20°C or slightly below (“room temperature”) is ideal for Lithium-Ion batteries. If a battery operates at 30°C, it’s lifetime is reduced by 20 percent. At 40°C, the losses in lifetime approach 40 percent, and if batteries are charged and discharged at 45°C, the lifetime is only half of what can be expected at 20°C.\\nThermal stability is critical to performance, longevity, and safety. Also equally important is maintaining uniform temperature throughout the system. Avoiding hot spots is crucial to preventing damage and mitigating the risk of triggering a chain reaction that leads to catastrophic thermal runaway.\\nApplications: Applications requiring rapid charging/discharging are referred to as having a high C-rate, defined as the charging or discharging current divided by the capacity (the amount of energy the battery can hold). With a high C-rate and frequent cycling, internal resistances to the higher currents generate heat.\\nAmbient temperature: High ambient temperature also damages batteries in several ways. One problem is that elevated temperatures lead to an increased rate of side reactions causing attrition of active material and resulting in a build-up of resistance at the electrode surface. Operating lithium-ion batteries at high temperatures will accelerate ageing and lead to performance degradation. Two types of ageing occur in combination due to lithium-ion batteries’ complex composition and working process: cycle ageing occurs while charging and discharging, and calendar ageing occurs over time while a battery is inactive.\\nParadoxically, low ambient temperatures can cause more problems with internal overheating than high ambient temperatures. One reason is that cold temperatures can result in viscosity changes in the electrolyte, leading to sluggish ion transport, resulting in higher resistance and heat generation.\\nVarious thermal management solutions are available, and the choice of the optimal solution is informed by the C-rate of the application, and the environmental conditions, among other factors. At the high end, the most demanding thermal management applications, such as large-scale BESS installation and high C-rate applications, require active liquid cooling. On the other end of the spectrum, smaller installations with low C-rate applications can be safely and efficiently operated at peak performance with air cooling.\\nOver the years, thermal management technologies have undergone significant advancements to meet the ever-growing cooling demands in the electrotechnical industry. For instance, Pfannenberg, a renowned manufacturer of thermal management products, initiated the development of innovative solutions in the 1950s, such as the pioneering filter fan, to regulate the temperature within electrical enclosures. Over the decades, Pfannenberg expanded its product range to include air and liquid cooling solutions for manufacturing processes and data centres. These diverse and well-established thermal management solutions effectively cater to the performance requirements and environmental conditions of a diverse range of BESS applications.\\nActive water cooling is the best thermal management method to improve BESS performance. Liquid cooling is highly effective at dissipating large amounts of heat and maintaining uniform temperatures throughout the battery pack, allowing BESS designs to achieve higher energy density and safely support high C-rate applications.\\nAs the BESS market evolves with a wide diversity of designs and applications, multiple versions of chillers are available to optimise the layout of the cooling system. For example, Pfannenberg offers two layout options. A stand-alone chiller can be placed inside the BESS. Each unit provides up to 12kW of cooling, and multiple units can be combined for easy scalability to support the highest cooling load requirements. Alternatively, a compact version is designed to be mounted outdoors on the cabinet door for a small footprint that allows easy integration inside battery cabinets and enclosures.\\nBoth solutions safely operate between -25 and +50°C and offer up to 800 V DC power supply to directly connect with the battery system, all while not needing any power conversion. The solutions offer CE/UL certifications for worldwide operations and high energy efficiency and reliability with their EC brushless fans and microchannel condensers. An inverter pump and compressor also provide better energy management during charge and discharge, while an internal heater preserves battery life in winter by maintaining a stable minimum temperature.\\nAt the other end of the spectrum, air cooling systems provide a cost-effective cooling solution for smaller stationary energy storage systems operating at a relatively low C-rate.\\nFor example, Pfannenberg’s DTS Cooling Unit seals out the ambient air and then cools and re-circulates clean, cool air through the enclosure. The closed-loop design isolates the external ambient air from the internally conditioned air eliminating the risk of contaminants entering the cabinet. The hermetically sealed compressor guarantees 100 percent cooling capacity efficiency.\\nIn applications where the cooling load is relatively low, and the surrounding air temperature is consistently lower than the desired enclosure temperature, filter fans offer a highly economical solution. These fans utilise natural convection to circulate the air and dissipate heat, providing an effective and cost-efficient cooling method.\\nEnergy storage is of paramount importance in the transition towards a carbon-neutral society. It enables the integration of renewable energy sources into electricity systems and enhances overall energy efficiency by effectively balancing energy production and consumption. In this context, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become indispensable.\\nTo ensure optimal performance, longevity, and safety of BESS, cooling systems play a critical role in maintaining thermal stability. When implemented effectively, these cooling systems help mitigate battery degradation and potential damage, thus reducing operational downtime.\\nAuthored by: Adam Wells, Solutions Engineer, Pfannenberg USA, Inc.\\xa0\\nChoosing filter fans for outdoor electrical enclosures: Key considerations\\nLiquid cooling solutions for industrial electronics for precise temperature control\\n\\t\\t\\tYou must be logged in to post a comment\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \\nDanfoss’ climate targets receive approval for its climate targets \\xa0from SBTi\\u202f\\xa0\\nIndia secures third global position in LEED Green Building Certification rankings in 2023\\nRole of tech-enabled HVAC systems in achieving greater energy efficiency\\nBITZER sets new benchmarks in the operation of reciprocating compressors\\nDanfoss unveils first sustainability technology center in Asia Pacific\\nQuality control order norms for the air conditioner industry relaxed\\xa0\\nMitsubishi Electric unveils its new Environmental Plan 2025\\nInterim Budget 2024-2025 nurtures green growth, skill development, and energy\\nSensibo incorporates an advanced AI assistant into smart HVAC, powered by ChatGPT\\xa0\\nProfitability vs. Environment: Assessing the green impact of cloud technology \\nThermal Control Business Update is a totally dedicated monthly magazine focusing on the latest news, trend, technology, and market scenario of Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration (HVAC-R).\\r\\nThe magazine is a right choice and the most valuable assorted resource for the industry, policy makers, analysts, strategists, entrepreneurs, and the newbies to get updated on the latest happenings in the HVAC-R. \\r\\nDanfoss’ climate targets receive approval for its climate targets \\xa0from SBTi\\u202f\\xa0\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated that the corporate greenhouse...\\nThermax aims to blend energy availability with sustainability\\xa0\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume Poised to contribute substantially to a greener future, Thermax has secured...\\nMECO Digit Multimeter-DMM 603+ comes with enhanced features\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume MECO introduces its latest innovation, the DMM 603+, a cutting-edge digital...\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume Thermax strengthens its water purification capabilities with the acquisition of TSA...\\nArmstrong DE Pumps to deliver a reduction in energy consumption\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume Design Envelope Permanent Magnet pumps employ cutting-edge motor technology for reduced...\\nASHRAE and ICC draft of carbon emissions evaluation standard open for review\\nListen this articleStopPauseResume ASHRAE and the International Code Council (ICC) released the full publication...\\nOur Business brands and partners want to send you information and opportunities by email.

Here’s how it works.\\nThe PC market is finally growing again, with 2024 projected to see an 8% uptick in shipments\\nA report from Canalys forecasts that the nearly two-year-long decline in PC shipments will finally end in Q4 of this year, flipping to a projected 5% growth. More growth is also projected to arrive next year, which will supposedly see 8% higher PC shipments than in 2023. Canalys expects the surging interest in AI and the arrival of ARM-equipped PCs to fuel this growth.(Image credit: Canalys)After reaching a high peak in 2021 on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic, PC sales have declined significantly ever since. Canalys expects the final tally of PC shipments this year to be lower than it was in 2019, wiping out all the gains made in 2020 and 2021. However, Canalys\\' forecast predicts 2024 will see the PC market recover to roughly 2019\\'s shipment levels, and then to 2020\\'s levels by 2026.A key assumption of this forecast is that new AI software and hardware will re-spark consumer interest in PCs. Canalys predicts that AI-powered PCs will account for 19% of all PCs shipped in 2024, a figure that includes M-series Macs and presumably PCs equipped with Ryzen 7000 or some of Intel\\'s latest CPUs like Meteor Lake.PCs with ARM chips are also expected to play an important role in the recovery of the PC market. Although Apple\\'s M CPUs use the ARM architecture, Canalys pointed out Qualcomm\\'s Snapdragon X Elite CPU as the primary driver of growth for ARM-based PCs. The firm previously predicted ARM chips would grab 30% share of the PC market by 2026.Of course, the health of the global economy is perhaps the biggest factor in whether consumers buy PCs. The decline of shipments in 2022 and 2023 was precipitated largely on potential buyers being more frugal with their money. The report only touches on this and merely mentions there is \"an improving macroeconomic environment.\" Assuming this recovery of the economy persists into 2024, then it could carry the PC market along.\\nStay on the Cutting EdgeJoin the experts who read Tom\\'s Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news — and have for over 25 years.

Anup has written professionally for over 5 years, and tinkered with PCs for much longer. His love for...\\nA future-proof PC is one that you won’t have to worry about upgrading for the next few years. Ideally, it should also be forward-compatible enough to allow the replacement of individual components in the future.\\nTo answer the question, you can future-proof your PC. But how future-proof you can make it depends on your expectations and budget.\\nI’ll describe the typical lifespan of future-proof PCs to help you set some realistic expectations. I’ll also talk about the key pointers when selecting components for a future-proof build.\\nWhat Is Future Proofing? How Is It Done?\\nThere are two main things to consider for future-proofing – the performance drop and forward compatibility. I’ll talk about compatibility later in the how-to section.\\nAs for performance, it’s a divisive topic with mainly two opposing viewpoints. Let me demonstrate with a common scenario. Say you’re building a PC soon.\\nFirst, you could build a 4K gaming PC with top-of-the-line components. It’ll give you high FPS with maxed-out settings for now. But a few years down the line, the performance will be at least halved in the most demanding games.\\nPeople spend a lot to build such decked-out systems. So, they tend to stick to the build for a few more years, even if performance is declining.\\nThe second approach is to build a mid-range PC with forward-compatible components. It’ll give you decent FPS with close-to-max settings. The price-to-performance ratio is awful on the highest-end components. So, you’ll save a ton of money with this build.\\nIn a few years, you’ll have to drop down to mid or low settings to play the latest games. At this point, you can use those savings to upgrade certain components.\\xa0Or, you can build a new mid-range system. \\nEither way, due to how fast PC hardware evolves, this build will perform much better than the 4K build from the first scenario.\\nThe way I see it – both are valid approaches.\\xa0\\nThe first approach gives you a better experience for the first few years, while you get a better experience in the later years with the second.\\nIs Future Proofing Worth It? Should You Do It?\\nAs stated earlier, the viability of future-proofing depends on the user’s expectations.\\xa0\\nPrograms become more demanding over time, and your PC will have a harder time keeping up. This is inevitable.\\xa0\\nAll you can do is build a system that’ll give you satisfactory performance for the next X years (4-5 years for the average person). \\nAs long as you have realistic expectations, you’ll be happy with your future-proof build. But if you’re expecting that the PC will perform well for 10+ years just because it’s high-end now, prepare to be disappointed. \\nOnto the main question – how do you actually future-proof your PC? Let’s go over the most important details for each component.\\nFirst, think about what you expect from your GPU and build in general. Do you plan to upgrade from 1080p to 1440p or 4K in the future? What kind of performance do you want a few years down the line? You’ll have to plan accordingly.\\nEnsure the GPU has enough VRAM. In 2024, 12 GB is the minimum for future-proofing. 16 GB or higher is ideal.\\nTry to get the latest-gen GPUs. This ensures access to the latest tech (FSR, DLSS, RayTracing, etc) and the best long-term support.\\nCPUs last a long time. So, plan for future workloads as best as you can. You can usually keep the same CPU while upgrading other parts like the GPU or RAM.\\nFor intensive gaming, get a CPU with excellent single-core performance and a high L3 cache.\\nIf you might use the PC for multicore tasks like video editing or 3D rendering in the future, prioritize high core count.\\nIn 2024, consider getting a CPU with DDR5 support. Although DDR5 hasn’t matured yet, having some support is much better for future upgrades than no support.\\nIn 2024, 16 GB is the minimum for future-proofing. 32 GB or more is ideal depending on the use cases.\\nPrioritize DDR5. DDR4 is still viable, but it’ll become obsolete as DDR5 matures in the next couple of years.\\nGet a board that supports the latest-gen components (CPU, RAM, etc). This will ensure the best long-term compatibility and allow you to upgrade parts in the future.\\nPrioritize boards with features that will become standard soon (e.g., USB-C currently).\\nYour storage drive will last you the next decade or so. So, get at least a Gen 4 NVMe SSD so that the speed doesn’t become a bottleneck in the later years.\\nAs for storage capacity, 1-2 TBs is a good starting point for most builds.\\nPSUs typically have a warranty of 5-7 years. If you get a reliable PSU with enough wattage headroom, it can last through multiple rebuilds and upgrades.\\nConsider the form factor, airflow, and aesthetics when choosing a case. A good airflow ATX case that looks good to you will allow for component upgrades and easily last a decade or two.\\nFor coolers and fans, try to stick to reputable brands. It’ll be easier to find accessories like mounting brackets when reusing them in the future.\\nHow To Know if CMOS Battery Is Dead\\nWhat Is CPU Cache?
